# Time Dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov Bogoliubov de Gennes

A software package to solve the dynamics of a non-uniform gas in
2D, in the Bogoliubov approximation.

Medium term plan.  Implement finite differences in a way compatible with ApproxFuns.  Use the operator and column matrix abstractions from ApproxFun to represent BdG spectra.
