Trial runs:

Boundary absorption 3.0 always fails due to sound waves around t = 6.

MOD with 0.01, 10 still has a vortex at t = 20, only loses 10% of atoms
    Images become pixelated, try larger boundary damping
    Images messy by t = 5, but Berry phase increases smoothly
    Neater images around t = 10, but Berry phase spurts
    Increasing absorption to 20 doesn't fix pixelation

0.03, 10 and 0.1, 10 go nuts

0.01, 30 loses vortex to moat

MOA, MOB, MOC 0.01 with more boundary absorption
