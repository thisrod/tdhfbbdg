1. Try all combinations of BC, initial condition, moat with C = 250, for a few dozen steps, on desktop.

MOC larger moat radius

Pixelation experiments

Note that 1 or 3 presteps shouldn't make a difference, with 100 steps later

100 steps, moat height 5, harmonic trap: unpixelated, parasitic solution at t=0.6
500 steps, moat height 5, harmonic trap: pixelated, small parasitic solution (check)

100 steps, moat height 5, flat trap: pixelated outside moat, small parasitic solution
1 step of relaxed density, 100 steps, moat height 5, harmonic trap: as for 0 steps
3 steps of relaxed density, 100 steps, moat height 5, harmonic trap: slightly pixelated
10 steps of relaxed density, 100 steps, moat height 5, harmonic trap: pixelated
